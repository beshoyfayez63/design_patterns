Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.

Applicability:
- Use the Facade pattern when you need to have a limited but straightforward interface to a complex subsystem.
- Use the Facade when you want to structure a subsystem into layers.

Pros:
- You can isolate your code from the complexity of a subsystem.

Cons:
- A facade can become a god object coupled to all classes of an app.
